## 🌟 Featured Project: PlanYourFuture

My most recent major project is **PlanYourFuture**, a full-stack development planner built for the CodeYourFuture community. I worked as part of a cross-functional agile team to deliver a high-quality MVP from scratch.

*   **Live Site:** [**PlanYourFuture**](https://planyourfuture-frontend.hosting.codeyourfuture.io/) <!-- Replace with your actual deployed URL -->
*   **Repository:** [**Faithy4444/Development-Planner-Group-2**](https://github.com/Faithy4444/Development-Planner-Group-2)

**PlanYourFuture** is a complete PERN stack application, containerized with Docker and deployed on Coolify. It features:
*   Secure user registration and login with JWT authentication.
*   A dynamic dashboard for creating, reading, updating, and deleting goals and tasks.
*   An advanced plan-sharing system that allows users to select which goals to share publicly with mentors.
*   A complete feedback loop, allowing mentors to submit advice that is then displayed on the user's private dashboard.
*   A robust End-to-End test suite built with Playwright to ensure application quality.

## 🌱 What I'm Focusing On

I am dedicated to a process of continuous learning and improvement. My current focus is on:

*   **Deepening my knowledge** of building and deploying scalable, containerized full-stack applications.
*   **Mastering professional workflows**, including GitFlow, agile methodologies, and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
*   **Writing clean, maintainable code** by applying SOLID principles and modern best practices.
*   **Sharpening my problem-solving skills** through daily challenges on Codewars and LeetCode.
